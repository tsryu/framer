In this section, we give you an overview of how code is used to create interactions in Framer, as well as a few simple pointers on how to set yourself up for success.

No matter what your background, we’ve designed Framer Code to be a fun and rewarding tool. For beginners, a familiarity with HTML, CSS or Javascript helps, but a desire to learn is just as important. Thousands of designers — most with no coding background — have started Framer and gone on to create amazing work, using it as a tool to level up in their careers. Over time, we’ve used their experience to develop a simple strategy to get you started with Framer.

Briefly skim through this guide to familiarize yourself with concepts, but don’t feel like you need to thoroughly understand everything before getting started. We’ve developed Framer as a conceptual learning tool. To that end, we’ve added many features that are designed to help lower the learning curve to code. From simplified language and Auto-Code to intuitive error messaging and in-app documentation, Framer guides you as you go.
