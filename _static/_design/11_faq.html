FAQ

How are my layers positioned?

The x and y position of your layers are turned into x and y properties. If you’re not working with Artboards, make sure all of your layers are part of a single layer group, positioned at 0,0.

Layers positioned at 0,0 will appear at the top-left corner of the canvas in Framer. Layers with negative coordinates are positioned outside the canvas.


Can I design in Artboards?

Yes, your Artboards also get imported. The position of the extreme left artboard on your canvas will be set to 0,0. All other Artboards are positioned relative to the most left artboard. This makes it easier to prototype multi-screen flows.


What happens to hidden layers?

Layers that you’ve hidden in Sketch are also imported, but visibility will be set to false by default.
