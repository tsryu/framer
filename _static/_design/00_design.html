Design

In this section, we’ll give you an overview of the Design tab in Framer, the perfect complement to the Code part of our product. Engineered specifically for responsive design work, it’s possible to dream up an idea and create a mockup in Design before turning it into a high-fidelity prototype in Code.

Framer’s Design interface will be familiar to most, with a large canvas, device preview and full-featured toolkit. Like many of the other graphics tools you already use, Framer Design offers the same insertable shapes and text, all easily styled using the properties panel. In this regard, it is a tool that has been optimized to feel familiar.


Where Framer Design starts to feel different is in the focus and power of its layout design feature set. Because it has been developed specifically for interactive design work, our graphics tool is able to make smart layout and hierarchy decisions for you. It intuitively guesses relative positioning and alignment making for a much more efficient flow when it comes to responsive design work.

You can use the Design tab independently, or in conjunction with the Code tab and Cloud collaboration, for a complete design workflow.
