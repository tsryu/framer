Properties

Style elements of your layers, from size, radius and position to fill, shadow and opacity. Use the alignment tools and live simulation to accurately lock and unlock layers.

Alignment Properties

On the right side of the design canvas, youâ€™ll find a properties panel. Much like any other graphics tool, it contains all the tools you need to style the properties of a particular layer. At the top of the panel is a series of align tool options. Use them to smartly position your layers within the artboard and in relation to each other.

Artboard Properties

You can alter the properties of your artboard, such as changing its fill color, size or position. To test the responsive nature of your artboards, select one or more at a time to bring up its properties, then switch devices. If all your content is correctly aligned, it should automatically adapt to the new dimensions of your artboard.

Layer Properties

To view the properties of layers, you can select one or more layers in the layer list or highlight them directly on your canvas. Framer offers almost all of the layer properties you expect, as well as some additional ones, like individual border radius.

In Framer Design, we give you the ability to control the behavior of your layers, down the most granular aspects of size and positioning. In the following sections, we go into detail about each advanced feature, which when used correctly, can be powerful beyond imagination.

Layer Positioning

When you place a new layer (child) on top of another layer (parent), Framer recognizes its placement and uses smart positioning to determine its anchoring in relation to the parent layer and the artboard. This vastly increases the efficiency of a typical design workflow. If you do need to change the anchor points at any time, you can manually do so using the positioning tool in the properties panel.

For example, if you place a menu bar layer (child) on the right side of a tab bar layer (parent), Framer will automatically guess that your menu bar should be right aligned anchored in relation to the tab bar. You can change the anchor points of layers at any time, by using the properties panel. To help you make anchoring decisions quickly and easily, Framer Design also offers a live simulation of how anchoring will work on the selected layer. The simulation will show you the responsiveness of a layer, based on the constraints you have selected.

Layer Sizing

To increase the efficiency of your workflow, Framer will automatically resize any child layers to mimic how parent layers (including artboards) are being resized.

Layer Clipping

Because Framer layers work within the parent-child relationship rather than grouping, clipping and masking are handled differently. To mask a layer, place the child layer on top of the parent layer and click on Clip in the properties panel. This will lock the child layer to the boundaries of the parent layer.

Text Alignment Properties

In Framer, text is inputted as a layer with some smart properties of its own. A text layer will align logically based on where it is placed on the parent layer (or artboard).

For example, a text layer placed on the left side of a navigation bar will immediately left align and anchor there, no matter how the parent layer or artboard is resized or scaled. You can alter the constraints of this automatic alignment at any time by selecting the text layer and using the positioning tool in the properties panel.

Resizing Text In Framer, you can change both the size of the text and the layer itself. Resizing the text field will resize the constraints of the layer, perfect for defining the width of a block of text.
