Artboards

Adaptive artboards that fit your responsive layout needs. Design each screen in sequence and in relation to its dimensions.

In Framer, artboards are no longer limited to a fixed width and height but instead, are dependent on the device you select. Because of Framerâ€™s automatic layout rules, artboards can still be resized at any time, with content adapting accordingly.

To insert an artboard, simply click the artboard icon in the top-left corner of Framer. Pro-tip: Press A for a shortcut to insert an artboard. Framer offers a list of preset artboards on the right that correspond with the most popular device screen dimensions. You can also create a custom artboard by selecting the artboard tool and click-dragging on the Canvas.

To speed up your design workflow we also guess where your next artboard should be placed. When one or more artboards are already placed on your canvas, Framer will use predictive sequencing technology to suggest the placement of your next artboard.
