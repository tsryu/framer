Canvas

Ground zero for experimenting with concepts and mocking up flows. Draw directly on the canvas or insert device specific artboards.

Framer Design offers a blank canvas to explore ideas through quick concepting or one-off mockups. You can draw directly on the canvas, import images and insert icons. Or set up a series of artboards to create a multi-screen app flow.

If you do decide to design directly on the canvas, all of the layers you insert will not contain a parent artboard. Placing your layer on the x: 0 and y: 0 position values will position the layer to the top left of the preview window when you toggle over to Code. Designing on the canvas works great for smaller interactions, but we recommend using artboards for complex and responsive app flows.

When working with the canvas, you can pan out for big picture perspective or zoom in to get your design pixel perfect. No matter how you like to work, the canvas supports
your design flow.
