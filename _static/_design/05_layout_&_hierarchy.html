Layout & Hierarchy

By focusing on automatic hierarchy and relative layout positioning, Framer lives up to the demands of modern day interface design.

Automatic Hierarchy

When you place a layer on the canvas in Framer, it is smart enough to guess the layer’s hierarchy based on its visual position. This sequencing will also be noted in the order displayed in the layer panel.

In this way, almost everything you place on the canvas will be ordered according to a parent-child relationship. Because we automatically guess hierarchy this way, you won’t have to worry about grouping any longer.
