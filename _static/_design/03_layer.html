Layers

The building blocks of Framer come in all shapes and sizes. Even better, layers in Framer respond to the environment around them, adapting to layout and hierarchy intuitively.

You can insert, manipulate and style rectangles, oval, text, images and gifs using the sidebar toolkit. Or use shortcuts like R for rectangle and T for text to speed up your workflow.

But layers in Framer are far from basic. To meet the demands of a responsive layout design, they have been programmed to auto-size or lock to boundaries and hierarchy. We dive deeper into this smart behaviour flow in the section on Layout & Hierarchy.

Aside from typical layers, Framer also supports drag and drop .gif files directly onto the canvas. The .gif behaves exactly as any layer and will auto-play within the Framer environment.
