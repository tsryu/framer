Targeting

To make the layers you designed in Framer usable in the code tab you have to enable targeting. Targeting only the layers you need will keep your document tidy and coding even easier.

Only the layers that have targeting enabled will be targetable in the code and show up in the layer list in the code tab.

To enable targeting click the target icon on the right of a layer in the layer list or right click 'Rename to Target'. Enabling targeting on a layer will activate the input field. If you have already renamed your layer before Framer will automatically correct the name to a format that is readable by the Framer code editor. If you have not renamed the layer before you will be prompted to insert a name. The preview on the right of the layer will show you the what your layer will be called in the code tab.

Targetable layers will have an active target icon next to their name. To delete or rename the target right click the layer in the layer list and choose 'Delete Target' or 'Rename Target'
