Additional Features

In this section we cover all of the additional tools available to you in Framer Design. You can access this set of features by right clicking on your layers in the layer list, on the canvas or the canvas itself.

Forward & Backward

Use this to quickly reorder hierarchy. Selecting a layer and clicking forward will move the layer higher up in the layer list, while backward will move it down. When you move a layer back and forward, its child layers will move with it.

Duplicate

Selecting a layer or an artboard and right-clicking ‘duplicate’ will copy and paste it onto the canvas, along with all the properties and child layers it contains. Duplicate artboards will be placed to the right of the original artboard, while duplicate layers will be stacked on top of the original layer.

Delete

Selecting a layer or artboard and right-clicking ‘delete’ will immediately remove it, along with all the child layer it contains.

Delete from Hierarchy

To delete only a parent layer while still retaining all its child layers, select the parent layer, right-click and select ‘delete from hierarchy’. This will remove the parent layer and return the children to their original hierarchy on the artboard or canvas.

Add Parent

Selecting two or more layers and right-clicking ‘add parent’ will group the two layers together and nest them under an invisible parent layer. Using automatic responsive layout rules, the two layers will now behave as a single entity. Resizing the parent will not affect the children.
