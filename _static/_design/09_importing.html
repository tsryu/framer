Importing

To add animation to designs you have set up in external graphics tools, simply import into Framer. We offer one-click integration with Sketch, Figma and Photoshop.

Get Started

Working in Sketch, Figma or Photoshop? Framer offers a fully integrated import workflow, so you can go back and forth as many times as you need. Currently, you can only import a design into Code to start animation.

Launch Framer, navigate into the Code tab and open a saved .sketch, Figma or .psd file. Then, click the Import icon in the bottom left sidebar. The popover will recognize the graphics file you have open. Be sure to save any file prior to importing into Framer. In the popover, you will also have the option to choose scale dimensions for your designs.
